        <p>Harmonizing human beings through collective sound</p>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p><strong>PTO</strong> is an artistic and vital experiment: a living exploration of how we rebuild inner order after traumaâ€”personal or collectiveâ€”using music as a bridge between fragmentation and harmony. It is also a street performance, a growing emotional archive, and an invitation to share more than just songs.</p>

        <p>Across cultures and time, singing has been seen as a direct way to access the subconscious. From Amazonian Ã­caros to gospel choirs, vocal ritual has helped communities reconnect with something deeper. PTO inherits this spirit, but brings it to streets, parks, beachesâ€”where people pass, pause, and participate.</p>

        <p>With a simple QR code, anyone can vote for a song, see its lyrics, andâ€”if they wishâ€”sing it. Sometimes they are filmed. Sometimes they become, for a moment, the protagonist of a shared musical instant. The performance becomes co-creation, and the data becomes emotion: weâ€™re building a collective emotional archive, moment by moment.</p>

        <p>This is not just an app. Itâ€™s a live investigation into how spontaneous sound can reorder and restore. Your support helps this experiment evolve and reach further.</p>
