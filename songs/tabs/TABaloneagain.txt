In a little while from now,    If I'm not feeling any less sour
  Em                                     C#m7b5         F#7
I promised myself to treat myself    And visit a nearby tower,
      Bm7                        Bm7b5         Dm6
And climbing to the top,    Will throw myself off
      A                 Aaug
In an effort to make it clear to who
     A6                         G#7
Ever what it's like when you're shattered
     C#m                           Em
Left standing in the lurch, at a church
                F#7b9 F#7
Where people're say___ing,
    Bm                                    Bm7b5           Dm6
"My God that's tough, she stood him up!No point in us remaining.
  Amaj7           A6           C#m  C#m7  F#7
We may as well go home."    As I did on my own... 
  Bm        E7b9     A
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday,    I was cheerful, bright and gay,
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do,
The role I was about to play    But as if to knock me down,
Rea__lity came around    And without so much as a mere touch,
Cut me into little pieces    Leaving me to doubt,
Talk about God and His mer___cy    Who if He really does exist
Why did He desert me    In my hour of need?
I truly am in__deed,      [Refrain]  [Bridge]

    C
It seems to me that There are more hearts
G7              G7/F                   Bm7b5
broken in the world     that can't be mended
Fm 5      C       F#m7b5       Emaj7             E9/B   E7
 Left unattended    What do we do?___ What do we do?

Now looking back over the years,  And whatever else that appears
     Em
I remember I cried when my father died
      C#m7b5               F#7
Never wishing to hide the tears
        Bm7                        Bm7b5
And at sixty five years old,    My mother, God rest her soul,
          A                  Aaug
Couldn't understand, why the only man
        A6                  G#7
She had ever loved had been taken
C#m                          Em               F#7b9 F#7
Leaving her to start with a heart    So badly bro___ken
    Bm                                Bm7b5         Dm6
Despite encouragement from me    No words were ever spoken
    Amaj7             A6        C#m       C#m7    F#7
And when she passed away    I cried and cried all day
