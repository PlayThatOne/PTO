[Intro]
Am    D     G     C   C/B
Am        D        G
Ah, ah
 
[Verse 1]
Am                  D
I'm the boy in your other phone
G                       C              C   C/B   Am
Lighting up inside your drawer at home all alone
                  D
Pushing 40 in the friend zone
G                    C         C     C/B
We talk and then you walk away every day
Am                  D
Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me
G                B7                     Am
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but
 
[Chorus]
           D                      G
But if you give me just one night
             C           C   C/B  Am
You're gonna see me in a new light
             D                     G
Yeah, if you give me just one night
            C              C   C/B
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Am                D                   G
Oh, I want a take two, I want to break through
                 C          C     C/B  Am
I wanna know the real thing about you
         D                     G
So I can see you in a new light
 
[Verse 2]
Am                D
Take a ride up to Malibu
G                    C            C       C/B
I just wanna sit and look at you, look at you
Am                           D
What would it matter if your friends knew?
G                    C          C  C/B
Who cares what other people say anyway
Am            D
Oh, we can go far from here
G              B7                  Am
And make a new world together baby
 
[Chorus]
              D                      G
'Cause if you give me just one night
             C           C     C/B  Am
You're gonna see me in a new light
             D                      G
Yeah, if you give me just one night
            C              C   C/B
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Am                D                   G
Oh, I want a take two, I want to break through
                 C           C    C/B Am
I wanna know the real thing about you
         D                      G
So I can see you in a new light
 
[Bridge]
(Ay, ay, ay, ay)
G            C
Em         D
 
[Solo]
Am       D
G        C    C  C/B
Am       D    G
E
 
[Chorus]
Am
Ah
             D                      G
Yeah, if you give me just one night
          C           C   C/B  Am
You gonna see me in a new light
             D                      G
Yeah, if you give me just one night
            C              C   C/B
To meet you underneath the moonlight
 
[Outro]
Am
What do I do with all this?
D                          G                                     C   C  C/B
What do I do with all this love that's running through my veins for you
(Repeat to end)
