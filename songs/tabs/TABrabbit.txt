White rabbit
Jefferson Airplane
F#                                             G
One pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small
             F#                                              G
and the ones that mother gives you don't do anything at all
            A     C                  D          A
go ask Alice when she's ten feet tall

And if you go chasing rabbits and you know you're going to fall
Tell'em a hooka smoking caterpillar has given you the cord
Call Alice when she was just small

E                                                                A
When men on the chessboard get up and tell you where to go
               E                                                                   A
and you just had some kind of mushroom and your mind is moving low
            F#            
go ask Alice, I think she'll know
                                                     G
When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead
and the white knight is talking backwards 
and the red queen's off with her head    Remember   what the Dormouse said
 E               A           E             A
Feed your head!    Feed your head!    Feed your head!
