Ah  ah  ah  ah  ah           Ah  ah  ah  ah  ah

Well the streets are all crowded Lots of people around
Dm                              A#
And there's music playing    But I can't hear a sound
Just the sound of the rain    Falling silently down
Livin' ain't been livin'    Since you put me down
Dm		  C	 	 G
Yeah, life goes on around me everyday
A
But it might as well be half a million miles away

F	    Dm
It's like a ghost town without your love
Am	  	A#
Like a ghost town without your love
Like a ghost town, baby, can't you see?
It's a ghost town until you come back to me
ah,  ah,  ah,  ah,  ah,    till you come back to me    ah,  ah,  ah,  ah,  ah

Well I wish I still had you    Had you here next to me
Baby, where did you go?    Baby, why did you leave?
Though the world, it keeps turnin'    But it don't turn for me
Without you in my life    My life ain't no place to be

There's only lonely days and empty nights
Ain't the same without you, baby, nothin' feelin' right    nothin' feelin' right.

Dm	     C                       Dm	          C       G
Darlin', I wanna leave this town         Don't wanna be around
I'm gonna leave this town    It's like a ghost town
