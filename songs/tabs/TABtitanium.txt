C  G/B  Am    x2
 
[Verse 1]
C              G/B
You shout it out
     Am
But I can't hear a word you say
C                 G/B           Am
 I'm talking loud not saying much
C          G/B        Am
 I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
C                G/B           Am
You shoot me down, but I get up
 
[Chorus]
F               G                 Em
  I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
        Am         F
Fire away, fire away
      G                    Em
Ricochet, you take your aim
        Am         F
Fire away, fire away
                 G                 Em
You shoot me down but I won't fall
        Am  F
I am titanium
                 G                 Em
You shoot me down but I won't fall
        Am  F
I am titanium
 
[Instrumental]
(F)  G   Em   Am
 F   G   Em   Am
 
[Verse 2]
C         G/B
Cut me down
         Am
But it's you who'll have further to fall
C         G/B           Am
Ghost town, haunted love
C             G/B   Am
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
C              G/B            Am
I'm talking loud not saying much
 
[Chorus]
F               G                 Em
  I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
        Am         F
Fire away, fire away
      G                    Em
Ricochet, you take your aim
        Am         F
Fire away, fire away
                 G                 Em
You shoot me down but I won't fall
        Am  F
I am titanium
                 G                 Em
You shoot me down but I won't fall
        Am  F
I am titanium

            I am titanium
(F)  G   Em         Am  F
            I am titanium
 
[Bridge]
(F)        G            Em
Stone-hard, machine gun
              Am
Firing at the ones who run
F          G                 Am
Stone hard, as bulletproof glass
 
[Chorus]
F                  G                 Em
  You shoot me down but I won't fall
        Am  F
I am titanium
                 G                 Em
You shoot me down but I won't fall
        Am  F
I am titanium
                 G                 Em
You shoot me down but I won't fall
        Am  F
I am titanium
                 G                 Em
You shoot me down but I won't fall
        Am  F
I am titanium
