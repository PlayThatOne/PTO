Freebird
Lynyrd Skynyrd  
G    D            Em      F            C              D
If I leave here tomorrow    Would you still remember me?
For I must be travelling on now
Cos there's too many places I must see
 
If I stay here with you girl    Things just couldn't be the same
Cos I'm as free as a bird now
F        C               D
And this bird you cannot change   x3  Lord knows I can't change
 
Bye bye, it's been a sweet love
Though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take it so badly
Cos the Lord knows I'm to blame
 
But if I stay here with you girl
Things just couldn't be the same  Cos I'm as free as a bird now
chorus     Lord help me I can't change

G    Bb      C         G  Bb      C
Lord I can't change    Oh I can't change
Fly high freebird oh yeah! . .
