Vera Lynn

We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when,
But I'm sure  we'll meet again some sun - ny day.
Keep smiling through, just like you always do
'Til the blue skies chase the dark clouds far  a - way.

So will you please say "Hello" to the folks that I know
Tell them I won't be long,
They'll be happy to know that when you saw me go
I was sing - ing  this song.
