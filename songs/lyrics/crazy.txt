Crazy 
Seal
 
 A man decides after seventy years   
That what he goes there for is to unlock the door  
  While those around him criticize and sleep    
  And through a fractal  on a breaking  wall   
I see you my friend and touch your face again 
  Miracles will happen as we dream 
 
 But we're never gonna survive  unless  we get little  crazy 
No we're never gonna  survive unless  we are a little    crazy 

  As the people walking through my head     
one of them's got a gun  to shoot the other one    
  and yet together they were friends at school  
  oh get it, get it, get it, yeah  
  If I were there when we first took the pill   
them maybe, them maybe, them maybe, them maybe 
  Miracles will happen as we speak 

[Chorus]
No, no, we’ll never survive, unless we get a little… babe

In a sky full of people  only some want to fly isn't that crazy                                
In a world full of people only some want to fly                 
Isn't that crazy ,crazy , crazy, crazy

In a heaven of people  only some want to fly          
isn't that crazy                                                
In a world full of people there's only some want to fly                 
Isn't that crazy ,crazy , crazy, crazy                 
[Chorus]
