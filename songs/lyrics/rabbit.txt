White rabbit
Jefferson Airplane

One pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small
and the ones that mother gives you don't do anything at all
go ask Alice when she's ten feet tall

And if you go chasing rabbits and you know you're going to fall
Tell'em a hooka smoking caterpillar has given you the cord
Call Alice when she was just small

When men on the chessboard get up and tell you where to go
and you just had some kind of mushroom and your mind is moving low 
go ask Alice, I think she'll know
When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead
and the white knight is talking backwards 
and the red queen's off with her head    Remember   what the Dormouse said
Feed your head!    Feed your head!    Feed your head!
