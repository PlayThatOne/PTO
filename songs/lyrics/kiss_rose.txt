Duba dabu dubiduu....

There there used to be a greying tower alone on the sea
You became the light on the dark side of me
But love remains a drug that´s the high not the pill
But did you know that when it snows,               [seen....
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can´t be 

Baby I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you the stranger it feels
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grey          Intro x2

There is so much a man can tell you so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
Baby to me you´re like a growing addiction that I can´t deny
Won´t you tell me is that healthy baby
But did you know that when it snows,
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can´t be seen
Chorus     

I´ve been kissed by a rose on the grey   x4
2nd verse and chorus once
