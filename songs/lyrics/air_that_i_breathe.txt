If I could make a wish  I think I'd pass,    Can't think of anything I need.
No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound,   Nothing to eat, no books to read.

Making love with you has left me peaceful, warm and  tired.
What more could I ask? There's nothing left to be desired.

Peace came upon me and in peace we weep,    So sleep, silent angel, go to sleep.

Sometimes all I need is the air that I breathe and to love you.
All I need is the air that I breathe, yes, to love you.
All I need is the air that I breathe._____________

Peace came upon me and in peace we weep,    So sleep, silent angel, go to sleep. 
Chorus to fade
